# Meltdown
A puzzle game about radiation built for [Pygame Community Easter Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-easter-jam-2023).

If trying to run this from source, be aware:
- The game requires Box2D (`pip install Box2D`) but as of writing this it doesn't seem like Box2D supports python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11. I recommend using python 3.8.
- The game requires [pygame-ce](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/) (not pygame). It will not work with regular pygame due to using a couple -ce features (color swizzling and text wrapping, mainly).
